I have done work related to client side i.e Phone Number Validation, Generate List of combinations and implement pagination but did not do fetching the code from mock server. I did not find the mock server to implement the logic but i have added sample code to call the service and the method how we pass the page number and limit to fetch only specific number of records.

I have implemented logic for 5 digits due to performance issue on client ( It can be resolved if we have server with pagination)

Instructions to run code, NPM Install and ng serve

I have also added screenshot of the UI
